## Branch Management

In order to maintain a structured development process, please create different branches for each user story or feature. Follow these guidelines:

1. Always create a new branch for each feature, user story, or bug fix.
2. Branch names should be descriptive of the task or feature, using kebab-case (e.g., `feature/add-registration`, `bugfix/fix-login`).
3. Before merging a branch into `main`, ensure it is tested and free of conflicts.

Example commands for creating a new branch:

```bash
# Create a new branch
git checkout -b feature/new-feature

# Make changes and commit them
git add .
git commit -m "Add new feature"

# Push the branch to the remote repository
git push origin feature/new-feature
```


Now you're ready to work on your feature or user story in your own branch.

Feel free to update this README with specific information about the VMS system, installation instructions, or any additional guidelines for development. Happy coding!
